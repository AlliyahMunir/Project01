## General info
This project has been created for the people with a sweet tooth. Alliyah's cupcakes are filled with flavor whether it be coffee, carrot, or simple chocolate. Furthermore, our natural baked goods have the ability to bring family and friends together with the binding of a cupcake.

## How To Use
The way that this program is set up, allows the user to view the menu for the cupcakes after the waiter "hands" it to them. When the cupcakes menu is displayed the user can choose the ingredients they would like in their cupcake. Furthermore, they will be asked the quantity of cupcakes they will be buying and will be told the wait time. Eventually, the user will be asked to fill out a survey in order for the bakery to make any improvements that are needed.
