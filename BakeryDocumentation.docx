To start off, I have always had a dream of owning my own cupcake bakery. Throughout my life, I spend most of my free time in the kitchen, baking. My success depended on whether or not my taste testers, also known as my family members, liked my baked goods. The one baked good that never failed to make them smile were my delicious cupcakes. Whether it was chocolate, vanilla, carrot, or coffee, it was always good. The reason I have created this bakery is to bring joy to those who work long hours and do not have time to peacefully sit down in a shop and enjoy their food. I want to bring joy within minutes after a customer orders, to show that my bakery is quick and delicious. This bakery is for the people, typically those with a sweet tooth, who need to satisfy their cravings. Whether customers order one or ten cupcakes, they will never feel unsatisfied. Additionally, the purpose of my bakery is to bring joy to the groups of families and friends who want to come together and eat cupcakes. While satisfying the cravings of my customers, I will get the joy of watching them smile as they take each bite. Now, to make this happen, I will need to have a strong business function. To start off, the business type that I will create is a sole proprietorship. This is because I believe that my company can be successful without the need of a partner. Also, I would like to make decisions on my own and make the final decisions on the recipes that I will be using. Lastly, I am aware that I will receive all profit and am responsible for all losses, yet I am willing to take the risk. Consequently, the strategy that I have chosen  for serving is to first greet the customer as they take a seat and have a waiter introduce them self while handing my personalized menu. When the customer is ready to order, the waiter will write down the order and give an estimated amount of time for the wait on the cupcakes. Once the order is ready, the customer can enjoy their meal. Besides this, there will be a need for a moto for the bakery which I have eventually chosen to be “Unlimited Flavor 24/7.” I chose this moto because the cupcake bakery that I have will sell cupcakes with unlimited flavor. No matter the flour, butter, or sweetener you use, your order will be delicious. Furthermore, the taste will always be satisfying whether you order at 8a.m. or at 9p.m.. When building the ideas of this bakery, I had the motive of introducing the world to a simple way to satisfy sweet cravings with whether it’s healthy or unhealthy. When it comes to financial responsibility and resources, I will make sure to buy the necessities first, such as ingredients, furniture, aprons, etc. beforehand. Once the shop opens, new ingredients will be bought every week as fresh cupcakes are made everyday by our chefs. When speaking about technical functions, large orders can be placed through phone call one or more days ahead of time in order to make it easier for the chefs to cook. The reason that customers cannot order an abundant of cupcakes on the spot is because the amount of time it will take to create 50+ customized cupcakes is long. Again, the purpose of my bakery is to allow customers to order a cupcake on-the-go, which cannot be done if large orders are brought in by every customer. Overall, these are my ideas of the future cupcake bakery that I plan to open called “Alliyah’s Speedy Bakery.”
